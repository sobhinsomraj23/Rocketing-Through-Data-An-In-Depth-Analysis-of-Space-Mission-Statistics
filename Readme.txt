Project Synopsis: Rocketing Through Data

1. Title
Rocketing Through Data: An In-Depth Analysis of Space Mission Statistics

2. Introduction
Space exploration has become a defining aspect of modern technological advancement, with numerous companies and countries contributing to the ongoing quest to explore beyond our planet. This project aims to analyze global space mission (1957 – 2020) data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to various aspects of space launches.
By examining key factors such as launch locations, company involvement, rocket performance, and mission outcomes, this analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of space exploration.
Through statistical and geographical analysis, we aim to identify the driving forces behind successful missions and offer valuable insights into the future trajectory of space endeavours.

3. Objectives
·         Analyze Trends Over Time: Examine the temporal distribution of space launches to identify trends, patterns, and seasonal variations in global space missions. 
·         Evaluate Company Performance: Assess the performance of different space companies by analyzing the number of launches, success rates, and the nature of missions       
          conducted. 
·         Geographical Distribution Analysis: Investigate the geographical spread of launch locations and assess how location impacts mission outcomes and success rates. 
·         Rocket Performance Assessment: Analyze the relationship between rocket characteristics and mission success, including an evaluation of active versus retired rockets. 
·         Mission Outcome Analysis: Explore the factors contributing to mission outcomes, with a focus on understanding the key determinants of successful versus failed missions.
