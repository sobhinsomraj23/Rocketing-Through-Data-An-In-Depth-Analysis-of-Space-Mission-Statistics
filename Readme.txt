Introduction
Space exploration has seen significant growth from 1995 to 2020, driven by both government and private entities. This project analyzes global space mission data from this period, focusing on key factors such as mission frequency, country involvement, costs, and success rates. 
With the potential asteroid threat predicted for 2038, this report also aims to assess which organisations are best equipped for asteroid impact prevention and prepare for planetary defence. By uncovering patterns and trends in space exploration, the project will provide insights into future missions and preparedness for celestial threats.

Keywords: mission frequency, country involvement, costs, success rates, asteroid impact, planetary defence, patterns, trends and celestial threats.

Objectives
Analyze Temporal Trends : Identify patterns and variations in global space launches over time, highlighting trends and seasonal shifts from 1995 to 2020.
Evaluate Company Performance: Assess the performance of space companies based on launch frequency, mission types, and success rates.
Geographical Analysis: Explore the distribution of launch sites worldwide and examine how location influences mission outcomes.
